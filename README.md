# ðŸª½ Termes: AI-Empowered Web Privacy

Termes is a web browser extension that uses OpenAI's GPT model to summarize and clarify 'terms and conditions' pages.

In the world of digital products and services, many people skip over the lengthy terms and conditions agreements (alternatively called 'EULA's, or end-user license agreements). These agreements may contain complex legal jargon, thousands of words, and other obstacles that make a thorough read-through unrealistic for the average user.

Termes delivers an accessible solution to this problem: a browser extension that helps users better understand what they are agreeing to. There are three major parts to Termes: a grading scale (inspired by ToS;DR), a highlight of any violation of rights, and a high-level summary of the terms.

Copy and paste your EULA into the app, and Termes will provide the key points about the document.

## Here's how to run Termes:

1. Launch two terminal sessions; one will be used for the frontend, and the other for the backend.
2. In one session, install a few modules:
```
pip install openai flask flask-cors
```
3. Enter your OpenAI API key:
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key-here'
```
  On Windows, use:
```
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
```
4. Run the backend:
```
python app.py
```
5. In the other session, run the frontend:
```
python -m http.server 8000
```
You should be able to access the working app at: http://localhost:8000

(Note: If you encounter an HTTPS error, it is most likely that the input was too long for the API to handle. Try shortening the input to 1000 words.)
